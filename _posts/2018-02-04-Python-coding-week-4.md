    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I multitasked with two screens. I found that checking my code every line, so I could be sure that I got it right. Coding slowly and carefully is more efficient that coding quickly and getting it wrong. I was also asked my partner at the right time for help. Flicking between looking at the board and my computer and my keyboard helped me write the correct code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to ask my partner less because I am relying on him to tell me what to write too much. I also need to learn how to spell print, or at least type it more accurately. I need to type more accurately, as I wonder how the code doesn't work and then I realise I have spelled print pirnt.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will not rely on my partner so much.
I will be careful on my spelling.
I will code slower and more carefully.</td>
  </tr>
