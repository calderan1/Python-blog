  <tr>
    <td>I found that multitasking on your computer which is when you have two web pages open at the same time. This really helped me because I needed to refer back to the worksheet while I was writing code. Remembering the code I was going to write was inefficient in two ways,1.) I had to keep flicking back and forth between the websites because I couldn't remember big chunks of code. 2.) When I tried to remember big chunks of code it was not reliable because I would remember the code wrong. Asking other people was a good thing to do as well, because it was another pair of eyes to check my code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to persevere more and not ask my partner as much though, because relying on the other person is not persevering. I need to do smaller bits of code if it is new, and bigger chunks of code if I am writing I have done before, then if I donâ€™t know the code I can get it right first time, and when it is something I know how to do i can do it quicker and in bigger chunks because I know how it is meant to be so I takes less time to check.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stop asking my partner so frequently about things, only ask if you can't spot the mistake.
Do new things slower and things I know quicker.
Use multitasking more efficiently </td>
