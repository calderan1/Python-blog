  <tr>
    <td>I found still that multitasking useful still, but this time, I used 3 different screens instead of 2, so that i could have my code writing, my google browser which had my doc of meanings of IT words , and the worksheet that I was working from. I also had a little help from other people, but reading up on google about how to code different people.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was being asked to help people a lot and this distracted me quite a lot, as people were asking me to come to their places to help them, therefore I couldn't stay by my computer to work. I also was looking for a lot of help from my partner. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will (although it sounds harsh) help less people.
I will ask for less help from my partner.</td>
  </tr>
