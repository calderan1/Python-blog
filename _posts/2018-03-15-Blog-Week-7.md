  <tr>
    <td>I did complete a couple of levels on code academy. I learned by only asking  for help when I need it, and also trying to help other people when they need it, as one of the best ways to learn is to teach what you already know. I find that talking to people helps me so working in silence didn't help me. I found that typing slower but carefully was the most efficient method of coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to stop asking for so much help, although I am getting better. I need to be more careful when coding I need to be more careful when Iâ€™m coding, because I waste a lot of time retyping things that I have mistyped.

    <td>Only ask for help when  you are really stuck.
Code more carefully so less time is wasted.</td>
