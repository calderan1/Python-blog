  <tr>
    <td>My partner wasn't in the Lesson so I had less help than usual but I persevered and I was just as successful, so using less hep os more beneficial. I made notes on what we were meant to do using a hash at the beginning. I used multitasking as well to help look at multiple screens at the same time. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was looking for someone to help me which meant I wasted time scooting around looking for help. I also need to stop trying to do extra things and just do the task.        </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will do the task and not try to to too much extra.
I will try not to use other peopleâ€™s help as much.</td>
  </tr>
