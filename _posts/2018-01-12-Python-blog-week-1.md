    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>No knowledge of how to code Python and no code academy account.

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have created an account and to have learned all of the Syntax part of Python/ the first level.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes and I managed to go a bit further than that too.</td>

    <td>Always coding slowly and carefully is the trick. Quite often I typed something quickly and the code didn't work because I had typed the variable wrong or I ha digo en something a capital letter when it shouldnâ€™t have one. I also payed a lot of attention of spacing and punctuation, so that looking for errors was a lot easier. I got along well but I did ask for quite a lot of help from the person next to me. The hints are also very helpful.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was not persevering much. When I got something wrong, I was not trying to find the error very effectively. Instead I was scanning over the code and not comparing what it should have said to what is does say. I need to not ask how to do something straight away, instead of keep trying until it works.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevere with coding before I ask for help.
Remember to code slowly and carefully.
Use the hint part of the instructions more because they are really helpful.</td>
