    <td>This blog is testing the ability to embed an image (screenshot) of the codecademy page where my achievement certificates are published.

By saving a new "Issue" containing a cut and paste of the achievements screenshot, I could link to and embed its image address.

I tested the coding by first embedding a logo image using this:

![Achievements]({{“https://calderan1.github.io/Python-blog/images/jekyll-logo.png” ¦ absolute_url }})

I have taken a screenshot using a Snipping Tool of this page of codeacademy achievements: 

<[https://www.codecademy.com/users/mookiemoo22/achievements](https://www.codecademy.com/users/mookiemoo22/achievements)>

Here it is embedded in my blog posting:

![Achievements]({{"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22446664/34922161-07d4b728-f984-11e7-9696-310ffdaf5333.png" ¦ absolute_url }})
