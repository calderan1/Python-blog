    <td>I had quite a big problem at the beginning of the lesson, as the code which should have been in the editor, there was not. So I had to restart level 3 of the Python course. This was distracting for about 10 minutes, but I redid the whole level ad then I could advance. I did however persevere through the 6th part. I was really stuck but I did manage to get through it once I had ask for a bit if assistance.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I had  got very distracted by my code not working at the start of the lesson, and this made me redo my work from previously. I wanted to try to get my work back, however I wasted a lot of time doing so. I should have just got on and repeated the work that I knew I had to do. I also always mistype things so I have to keep trying to be more accurate

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
